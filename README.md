# Amazon-UI-Clone
This is a UI clone of the Amazon.com website. I have extracted the images of products and creatives from the original website itself and used my skill to clone the exact landing page of the Amazon.com. This is one of the intial projects that i made after learning css. Built entirely with HTML and CSS, this project has been a great way to enhance my CSS skills .
Although I couldn't implement the carousels/slidebar part, because I didn't learn JavaScript at that time but I'm looking forward to adding more functionalities like these as now I have learnt JavaScript. 
Happy learning ! ðŸ’¡
